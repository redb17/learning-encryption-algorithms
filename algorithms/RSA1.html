      RSA is also a
      <span class="keyword">public key exchange</span> protocol. Two
      <span class="keyword">keys (key pair)</span>:
      <span class="keyword">public key</span> and
      <span class="keyword">private key</span> are generated by each of the two
      parties. <span class="keyword">Public key</span> is made public and
      <span class="keyword">private key</span> is kept private by each of the
      two parties. These two <span class="keyword">keys</span> have the property
      that a <span class="keyword">message</span> encrypted by either one key
      can only be decrypted by the other <span class="keyword">key</span> of the
      <span class="keyword">key pair</span>, hence these are called
      <span class="keyword">assymetric keys</span>. These
      <span class="keyword">key pairs</span> are generated by some key
      generation algorithms and libraries like ssh-keygen.

      The algorithm: <br />
      Suppose <span class="keyword">P1</span> and
      <span class="keyword">P2</span> want to establish a secured
      <span class="keyword">session</span> between them.
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>
        <span class="keyword">P1</span> generates a
        <span class="keyword">key pair</span>:
        <span class="keyword">pub1</span>, <span class="keyword">pvt1</span>.
        Same way, <span class="keyword">P2</span> generates a
        <span class="keyword">key pair</span>:
        <span class="keyword">pub2</span>, <span class="keyword">pvt2</span>.
        Both <span class="keyword">pub1</span> and
        <span class="keyword">pub2</span> are made public.
      </li>
      <li>
        <span class="keyword">P1</span> encrypts a
        <span class="keyword">message</span> with his private key
        <span class="keyword">pvt1</span> and then with P2's public key
        <span class="keyword">pub2</span> and sends to
        <span class="keyword">P2</span>.
      </li>
      <li>
        <span class="keyword">P2</span> decrypts the
        <span class="keyword">message</span> with his private key
        <span class="keyword">pvt2</span> and then with
        <span class="keyword">P1's</span> public key
        <span class="keyword">pub1</span>.
      </li>
    </ol>

    <p>
      <span class="keyword">Authentication</span> is done with RSA. <br />
      <span class="keyword">P2</span> upon successfully decrypting the
      <span class="keyword">message</span> with
      <span class="keyword">pub1</span> can be
      <span class="keyword">sure</span> of that the
      <span class="keyword">message</span> is sent by
      <span class="keyword">P1</span> and no one else, since only
      <span class="keyword">P1</span> can encrypt a
      <span class="keyword">message</span> which is decrypted successfully by
      <span class="keyword">pub1</span>.
