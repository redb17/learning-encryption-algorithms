      Earliest and simplest cryptography algorithm. <br />
      Each character of the input <span class="keyword">message</span> is
      replaced by shifting it <span class="keyword">some</span> number of
      positions down (or up) the alphabets. After the letter 'Z', the shifting
      circles back from 'A'.

    <p>
      For example if a <span class="keyword">prior decision</span> is made to
      use <span class="keyword">positions</span> as
      <span class="keyword">3</span> and
      <span class="keyword">direction</span> as
      <span class="keyword">down</span>; then a
      <span class="keyword">message</span> would be encrypted as the following:
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="keyword">Meet me at the end.</span> âž¡
      <span class="keyword">Phhw ph dw wkh hqg.</span>
