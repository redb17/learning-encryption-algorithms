    <p>Problems with <span class="keyword">Caesar Cipher:</span></p>
    <hr />
    <ol>
      <li>
        There has to be a prior physical meeting between the
        <span class="keyword">sender</span> and
        <span class="keyword">receiver</span>.
      </li>
      <li>
        An attacker can keep collecting the
        <span class="keyword">messages</span> until he gets the
        <span class="keyword">key</span> and then all the prior
        <span class="keyword">messages</span> can be decrypted hence
        <span class="keyword">no forward secrecy.</span>
      </li>
      <li>
        If an attacker gets the key then he could act as the
        <span class="keyword">receiver</span> (for the actual sender) and
        <span class="keyword">sender</span> (for the actual receiver); and not
        just read but also could change the messages between the two.
