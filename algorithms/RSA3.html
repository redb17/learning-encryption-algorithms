      A combination of <span class="keyword">RSA</span> and
      <span class="keyword">Diffie Hellman</span> is used to get all the pros
      minus all the cons of both protocols.
      <span class="keyword">Static RSA keys</span> are first used to set
      <span class="keyword">authentication</span> between the two parties. Then,
      <span class="keyword">ephemeral Diffie Hellman keys</span> are exchanged
      and <span class="keyword">messages</span> are shared between the two
      parties.
    </p>

    <p>All the Pros:</p>
    <hr />
    <ol>
      <li>
        <span class="keyword">Static RSA keys</span> can be used as
        <span class="keyword">RSA</span> key generation is slow.
      </li>
      <li>
        <span class="keyword">Authentication</span> is achieved due to
        <span class="keyword">RSA</span>.
      </li>
      <li>
        <span class="keyword">Forward Secrecy</span> is achieved since a new
        <span class="keyword">key</span> is generated for each
        <span class="keyword">session</span>; due to
        <span class="keyword">ephemeral Diffie Hellman keys</span>
        as generation of these keys is fast.
